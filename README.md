Ludo is a children's game created in late Victorian times and based upon the ancient Indian game 
of Pachisi. There are other Western versions of Pachisi such as Parch√≠s from Spain, Parcheesi 
from the USA and Uckers, a form of Ludo played in the Royal Navy (and apparently some nonBritish navies) on a Ludo board.
